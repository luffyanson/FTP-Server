# FTP-Server

The goal is to build a simple FTP server and client that will also interoperate with selected implementations 
of the standard Internet FTP service commonly used in this department. 
Here is the first piece of an FTP server â€“ string-parsing and a basic engine to serve files. 
In the future, I will extend this program to communicate with a remote client.
